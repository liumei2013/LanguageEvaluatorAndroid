    <string name="ielts_req">
        The overall score of IELTS exam of applicants needs to be equal or above 6.5 and the scores
        for writing and reading skills should not be below 6.0.\n\n
        If your overall score is 6, and your reading and writing scores are at least 6, you will be
        eligible for conditional admission. So you need to take an English course in the first
        semester. Otherwise you have to retake the IELTS exam.\n\n
        Thanks for choosing Concordia.
